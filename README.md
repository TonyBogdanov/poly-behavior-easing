## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

And init your project with:

    bower init

## Installation

Install the component with:

## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, it's recommended that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at `http://localhost:8080/components/poly-behavior-easing/`.
